							<p>Welcome, friends!</p>
							<p>My name is Nicholas, but you can call me Nick if you'd like!</p>
							<p>I graduated with a BS in Applied Mathematics and a BS in Computer Science in Florida International University in summer of 2019.</p>
							<p>I have an insatiable desire to grow on both a professional and a personal level, which is why I wish to seek the most intellectually stimulating opportunities in all areas of my life, hence part of my motivation behind pursuing the two challenging fields mentioned above.</p>
							<p>I have extensive experience with interpersonal communication and team leadership, as evident in my experience in STEM education as a teacher, tutor, learning assistant, outreach leader, and camp director. Along with team motivation and leadership, in each of these areas, I placed emphasis on promoting diversity and inclusion of girls, women, and LGBT individuals in STEM. I believe that these qualities would make me an asset and a great investment for a tech company as a future mentor.</p>
							<p>Apart from technology and assisting others in STEM, some of my favorite pastimes are playing video games, listening to and producing music, learning languages (not just programming ones!), and conquering escape rooms!</p>

							<p>FL Studio is the digital audio workstation I use to make my own music. I got into it in 2017 since I was into the indie music scene (Don't worry: I still am!). Enjoy this five-minute-long tutorial!</p>
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26yYnRnmtME"><img class="interests-image" src="images/Suikoden_Logo.png" style="background: white; padding: 30px"/></a>
							<p>This is the video game franchise that I hold dearest to my heart. I remember watching my brother play when I was 3 years old and finally getting into it in elementary school. This is a story about love, betrayal, friendship, and most importantly, reminding yourself that even if the future seems bleak, there is hope.</p>
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9XKLqGqwLA"><img class="interests-image" src="images/ywvutt1582892285.png"/></a>
							<p>Grimes is the artist who was one of the final nudges for me to start making my own music. Grimes started off as a DIY artist who made her first three albums (all masterpieces, by the way) on GarageBand, which is the free digital audio workstation that comes with your Mac! Check out her music video for "Realiti"!</p>
							<a target="_blank" href="https://morty.app/@universearcana"><img class="interests-image" src="images/Morty-logo (1).png"/></a>
							<p>This app only exacerbates my obsession with escape rooms. As someone who thoroughly enjoys solving problems, I was always intrigued by the idea of an escape room. I tried my first one in 2018, and the rest is history. Check out all the rooms I've done!</p>
							<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7NZrh8aEW8"><img class="interests-image" src="images/tufaan.png"/></a>
							<p>Did I mention that I was in an a cappella group? I had such a blast with these people, and I love that I got to experience a new realm of music (for me): Bollywood! That's right: we were a South Asian fusion a cappella group. Funnily enough, I didn't know this until I got into the group! Enjoy a recording we did (I'm in the video) and our performance at a competition in 2014 (I am also in this video, as you can see from the photo).</p>
